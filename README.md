### Whis is this contraption?

This repository holds the technical information that the author has aquired and deemed relevant to note over their career.

### Okay, cool. Why?

The main reason for doing this is that in an industry where people are always expected to learn new stuff as it is ever changing, it is handy to keep notes of some important stuff that might get lost along the way. The old saying:
> *Out with the old, in with the new*

Well this repo is designed to help save the old if ever needed in future.

The other reason for this is that the author recognised that everyone learns in different ways. They, for example, learn via e-learning videos. So...essentially, you might find this repo is not tailored towards your specific learning style but it is what the **author** thought would help **them**.<br>
*Yeah, selfish I know... if you don't like it then make your own damn repo! :)*

### So this has the authors opinions?

No.
.
.
.
This repo contains only facts *(and are referenced where applicable)*. The main reason for entire objectivity here is that subjective views are so commonly outdated in this industry and, therefore, facts are the safest option. If you want to debate something, become a contributor and the author will review. In short, it can be said that this repo is just an accumulation of facts on different topics that are tailored towards how the author learns.

### What are the current topics in this repo?

Yep. Great question and 1 that needs answering. Also, it is worth pointing out that these topics are broad and not specific stuff (i.e. section on 'Design Patterns' **not** 'the Fascade pattern' or a section on 'Server-side frameworks' not on '.NET') so it is great for people like the author that follow the "Jack of all trades, master of none" principle. Anyway, the topics currently held in here are:
  - [Architecture](architecture/general.md)
  - [Cryptography](cryptography/)
  - [Machine Learning](machine_learning/)
  - [Networking](networking/)

Happy learning!! :)
