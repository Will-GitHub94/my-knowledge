# Software Architecure

### Description

Software Architecture is the *blueprint* of a sytstem. It will define such things as:

- Performance
- Modifiability
- Security

I see it as the structure of a system and **does not** define technologies used. For example, you may say that we are using an MV* architecture, but nowhere in the report should you mention that we are using Angular2 for this...

Software Architecture defines the relationships of elements within a system

In manufacturing world, using atoms which are very hard to change but in software, dealing with bits which are very maluable
