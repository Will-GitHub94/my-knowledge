### Architect

***

The issue with being an "architect" is that it is a very ill-defined role. There are tons of job titles with "architect" in the name (i.e. Systems Architect, Business Architect, Network Architect etc..)

Decisions to be made:

+ Architectural decisions
  + **TYPE** of tech to use but not the **IMPLEMENTATION** of the tech to use *(i.e. using a web-based client? YES ... using Ionic cordova Cordova? NO)*

  > *"An architect may be **responsible** for making technology decisions, but the decision is not an architectural one"*<br>
  > *"The choice of technolgy should not derive the architecture but should be other way around"*


+ Expectations
    + Analyse Technology, industry, & market trends and keep current in those trends
    + Analyse current technology environment & recommend solutions for improvement

        For example, you are having release management pain... it is the duty of the architect to make it work and also ask the question of "why can't we deploy successfully?", "why can't we meet our targets?", "why are our sprints always late?" etc...


    + Ensure compliance with the architecture
    + Having exposure to multiple and diverse technologies, platforms, and environments (i.e. .NET, Ruby on Rails, C++)
    + Possess expectational interpersonal skills (teamwork, facilitation, and negotiation)
    + Define the architecture and design principles to guide technology decisions for the enterprise
    + Understand the political climate of the enterprise and be able to navigate the politics


Architecture aspects:

+ Leadership & communication
+ Technical knowledge
+ Business domain knowledge
+ Methodolpgy & strategy
