# Splitting the data set into Training & Evaluation data

Model will learn from **training** set & will be tested on its performance on the **evaluation** set.<br>
*The performance on the evaluation set should not be that different from the performance on the training set as this would mean the model understood the **correlations** between the date and did not just learn the data "by heart" so to speak...*

Usually a good size for the evaluation set is **20-30%** of your entire data set leaving the rest to be the training set
